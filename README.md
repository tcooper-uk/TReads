# TODO
The goal here is really to play around in java with intellij and get familiar with the ecosystem.
I'll aim to touch on the following at a minimum:

- Basic console application
- Basic maven package management
- Communicate with a REST endpoint (no auth)
- Use IoC for dependencies
- Store some data into a database
- Use some ORM...
- Test everything, TDD
- Mock something


## To Build

Let's build an app that will give me an article to read each day. Initially I can source our articles from [dev.to](https://dev.to/),
however the feed of article should be open to extensibility. Simply the link to the article will suffice, there's no need to download the body at this stage.

Once I have found an article for the day a record of this should be stored in a database.

We could extend the functionality of our application to provide articles on demand.
